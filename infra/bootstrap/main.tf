# Bootstrap stack — creates the Terraform state bucket that the `dns`
# stack uses as its remote backend.
#
# Run ONCE per AWS account, with LOCAL state. After `terraform apply`,
# the `dns` stack's `backend.tf` already points at the bucket created
# here.
#
# State locking uses S3-native conditional writes (`use_lockfile =
# true` in dns/backend.tf) — supported since Terraform 1.10. No
# DynamoDB table is required.
#
# This stack is the ONLY one that uses local state; do NOT migrate its
# own state into the bucket it creates (chicken-and-egg). Its local
# state file is gitignored — losing it is fine: the bucket already
# exists, so a re-apply would no-op or `terraform import` re-adopts it.
