# DNS for jaredhoward.com — the apex public hosted zone for this
# account (the "Jared" account). This zone is the root of the whole
# personal estate's DNS: it serves the GitHub Pages site, carries the
# Migadu mail records, and delegates disag.jaredhoward.com to
# project-disag's account.
#
# The zone + every record below pre-existed this Terraform and were
# manually managed. They were ADOPTED by import (one-shot import
# blocks, since retired) on 2026-07-10, not recreated — the live zone
# is now fully Terraform-managed. Getting a record definition wrong
# here breaks the live site, email, OR the disag delegation, so treat
# every apply as load-bearing (see docs/domain-setup.md).
