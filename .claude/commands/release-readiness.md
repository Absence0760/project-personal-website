description: Pre-tag readiness gate. Checks working tree, main, CI status, and the delta since the last release tag. Reports a green/red checklist. Read-only; never tags.
---

Run a pre-tag readiness audit before publishing a GitHub release. Report a green/red checklist; never tag, push, or publish anything. The operator does the actual `gh release create` after they've reviewed the report.

## Why this exists

The deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) fires on every push to `main`, not on tag, so "releases" here are an operator-driven habit rather than a CI gate. The point of this command is to give the operator a single yes/no before they tag — "is the site currently in a state I'd be happy to call `vX.Y.Z`?"

A failing universal gate (dirty tree, CI red, unpushed commits) almost always means what's deployed differs from what the tag will point at, which is the actual operational footgun this command exists to catch.

## When to use

**Right fit:** the operator is about to cut a release tag and wants a single yes/no.

**Wrong fit — refuse:**
- The operator is on a feature branch (not `main`) — explain that releases tag from `main`, ask whether to switch.

## Procedure

### 1. Confirm we're on main

```
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If not `main`, abort with: "releases tag from `main`; you're on `<branch>`. Switch with `git checkout main && git pull`, then re-run."

### 2. Run the universal gates

For each, mark **green** / **red** and capture a one-line reason for any red.

#### 2a. Working tree is clean

```
git status --porcelain
```

Empty → green. Anything → red ("uncommitted changes in: <files>"). There are no SOPS plaintext siblings to worry about in this repo — but flag any unexpected `public/` output that didn't get gitignored.

#### 2b. main is up to date with origin

```
git fetch origin main
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD
```

Both `0` → green. Behind → red. Ahead → red ("local main has unpushed commits — push first, wait for CI, then re-run"). Note: `git push` is on the `.claude/settings.json` deny list by default; surface this as a manual step.

#### 2c. Latest CI run on main is green

```
gh run list --branch main --limit 1 --json status,conclusion,workflowName,headSha,createdAt
```

`status=completed` and `conclusion=success` → green. Anything else → red ("CI on the head commit is `<status>/<conclusion>` — wait for green or investigate").

Also check the most recent runs of the security workflows on `main`:

```
gh run list --workflow=codeql.yml --branch main --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=gitleaks.yml --branch main --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=scorecard.yml --branch main --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --branch main --limit 1
```

If any have an open failed run, surface as an amber row (informational; doesn't block but worth knowing). `deploy.yml` red is the one to actually treat as red — that means what's "deployed" doesn't match `main`.

If `gh` isn't installed or the operator isn't logged in, recommend `gh auth login` and skip — don't fail the whole report.

### 3. Delta since last release

Find the last release tag:

```
git describe --tags --match 'v[0-9]*' --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "(no prior release tag)"
```

If there is one, list the commits + files changed since that tag, grouped by directory:

```
git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD
git diff --stat <last-tag>..HEAD
git diff --name-only <last-tag>..HEAD | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort -u
```

Report:
- **Commits since:** count + one-line summaries
- **Top-level paths touched:** `content/`, `templates/`, `static/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, root (single-line summary per)
- **Legal-page changes:** explicit yes/no on `content/{terms,privacy,refunds,contact}.md` and `docs/legal-status.md`. If yes, surface as amber — the operator should re-skim `docs/legal-status.md` "Maintenance rhythm" before tagging.

If `Commits since` is `0`, flag as red — there's nothing to release.

### 4. Sanity checks

#### 4a. Open security signals

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
```

Non-zero either → amber. Don't block; just surface.

#### 4b. Legal-status tracker hot items

```
grep -c '\[ \] \*\*' docs/legal-status.md
```

If the tracker has open items in the "Launch gates" section that map to current legal-page commitments, surface those — they're hard blockers for "first paying subscriber", which a release tag implicitly says you're ready for.

### 5. Build the report

```
# Release readiness — proposed `v<x.y.z>`

## Universal gates

| Gate | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| On main | green / red | ... |
| Working tree clean | green / red | ... |
| main pushed + in sync with origin | green / red | ... |
| CI green on HEAD | green / red | ... |
| Deploy workflow green on HEAD | green / red | ... |

## Delta since `v<last>`

- Commits: <n>
- Top-level paths touched: <list>
- Legal-page changes: <yes/no — and which if yes>

## Open audit signals

- CodeQL alerts open: <count>
- Dependabot alerts open: <count>
- Legal-status open launch-gate items: <count + brief>

## Changelog draft (commits since `v<last>`)

- abcd123 commit subject
- ...

## Verdict

ALL GREEN — ready to publish a release with:
  gh release create v<x.y.z> --title "v<x.y.z> - <short summary>" --notes "<...>"

or

NOT READY — fix the red items above first
```

### 6. Hand off

End with:

> If everything's green, the next step is:
> ```
> git push origin main      # if you have commits ahead
> gh release create v<x.y.z> --title "..." --notes "..."
> ```
> I won't run those — `git push` and `gh release create` are both on the deny list by default. That's your call.

**Do not tag, do not push, do not create a release, do not auto-fix any of the red gates.** This command is read-only.

## Notes

- The whole thing should take under a minute. If a gate hangs (e.g. `gh run list` on a slow connection), skip it with a `skipped — <reason>` row rather than blocking the report.
- `gh` is required for the CI-status check and the open-alert sweep. If unavailable, fall back to a one-line note: "install `gh` to auto-check CI; manual: open the Actions tab and confirm green on the head commit."
- This command does NOT replace `docs/domain-setup.md` or any deploy procedure. It's a pre-flight, not the release procedure itself.
